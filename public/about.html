<h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>At the intersection of precision engineering and creative coding, you'll find me – an industrial engineer turned digital craftsman. I've traded assembly lines for command lines, bringing a unique blend of systematic thinking and entrepreneurial spirit to the web development world.</p>

        <h2>The Plot Twist</h2>
        <p>While most developers start their journey in Computer Science, I took the road less traveled. My background in industrial engineering taught me to optimize processes, solve complex problems, and most importantly, to see inefficiencies as opportunities. Now, I'm applying these same principles to create digital solutions that make life a little more interesting (and hopefully a lot more efficient).</p>

        <h2>Current Chapter</h2>
        <p>These days, you'll find me deep in the trenches of web development, building my arsenal of digital tools one project at a time. I'm on a mission to transform from shop floor optimizer to solo developer entrepreneur. Think of it as a modern-day craftsman's journey, but instead of a hammer and chisel, I'm wielding JavaScript and CSS.</p>

        <h2>The Master Plan</h2>
        <p>My goal? To create meaningful digital experiences that solve real problems – and yes, maybe make some money along the way. I believe the best products come from a perfect blend of engineering precision and creative problem-solving. Each project is an opportunity to combine my industrial engineering mindset with the limitless possibilities of web development.</p>

        <h2>When I'm Not Coding</h2>
        <p>You might find me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sketching out new project ideas on any available surface</li>
            <li>Optimizing my coffee brewing process (old habits die hard)</li>
            <li>Reading about the latest web technologies while trying not to fall down the rabbit hole</li>
            <li>Probably reorganizing something, because efficiency never sleeps</li>
        </ul>
